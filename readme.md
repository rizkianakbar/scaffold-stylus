## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Foundry Cast](https://getfoundry.sh/)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-Stylus, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arb-Stylus/scaffold-stylus.git
cd scaffold-stylus
yarn install
# Initialize submodules (required for Nitro dev node)
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install Stylus tools

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and then install the Stylus CLI tool with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --force cargo-stylus cargo-stylus-check
```

**Prerequisite:**

- `cargo-stylus` version `^0.6.1`
- `rustc` version match with `packages/stylus/your-contract/rust-toolchain.toml`

Set default `toolchain` match `rust-toolchain.toml` and add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build target to your Rust compiler:

```bash
rustup default 1.87
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.87
```

You should now have it available as a Cargo subcommand:

```bash
cargo stylus --help
```

### 3. Run a local network

In your first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Stylus-compatible network using the Nitro dev node script (`./nitro-devnode/run-dev-node.sh`). The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the Nitro dev node configuration in the `nitro-devnode` submodule.

### 4. Deploy the test contract

In your second terminal:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/stylus/your-contract/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/stylus/scripts` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script .

### 5. Start your NextJS app

In your third terminal:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app at: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the **Debug Contracts** page, which provides a user-friendly interface for testing your contract's functions and viewing its state.

### 6. Test your smart contract

```bash
yarn stylus:test
```

## Development Workflow

- Edit your smart contract `lib.rs` in `packages/stylus/your-contract/src`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/app`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/stylus/scripts`

## Create Your Own Contract

Scaffold-Stylus enables you to create and deploy multiple contracts within a single project. Follow the steps below to create and deploy your own contracts.

### Step 1: Generate New Contract

Use the following command to create a new contract and customize it as needed:

```bash
yarn new-module <contract-name>
```

The generated contract will be located in `packages/stylus/<contract-name>`.

### Step 2: Deploy Your Contract

```bash
yarn deploy [...options]
```

This command runs the `deploy.ts` script located in `packages/stylus/scripts`. You can customize this script with your deployment logic.

**Available Options:**

- `--network <network>`: Specify which network to deploy to
- `--estimate-gas`: Only perform gas estimation without deploying
- `--max-fee=<maxFee>`: Set maximum fee per gas in gwei

**Note:** Deployment information is automatically saved in `packages/stylus/deployments` by default.

## Deploying to Other Networks

To deploy your contracts to other networks (other than the default local Nitro dev node), you'll need to configure your RPC endpoint and wallet credentials.

### Prerequisites

1. **Set the RPC URL**

   Configure your target network's RPC endpoint using the proper `RPC_URL_<network>` environment variable. You can set this in your shell or create a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference):

   ```env
   RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://your-network-rpc-url
   ```

   **Note:** If RPC URL is not provided, system will use default public RPC URL from that network

2. **Set the Private Key**

   For real deployments, you must provide your own wallet's private key. Set the `PRIVATE_KEY_<network>` environment variable:

   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY_SEPOLIA=your_private_key_here
   ```

   **Security Note:** A development key is used by default when running the Nitro dev node locally, but for external deployments, you must provide your own private key.

3. **Set the Account Address**

   Set the `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_<network>`

   ```env
   ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=your_account_address_here
   ```

4. **Update Frontend Configuration**

   Open `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` and update the `targetNetworks` array to include your target chain. This ensures your frontend connects to the correct network and generates the proper ABI in `deployedContracts.ts`:

   ```ts
   import * as chains from "viem/chains";
   // ...
   targetNetworks: [chains.arbitrumSepolia],
   ```

### Available Networks

This template supports Arbitrum networks only. You can test which networks are available and their RPC URLs:

```bash
yarn info:networks
```

This will show you all supported networks and their corresponding RPC endpoints.

### Deploy to Other Network (Non-Orbit Chains)

Once configured, deploy to your target network:

```bash
yarn deploy --network <network>
```

**Important Security Notes:**

- The values in `.env.example` provide a template for required environment variables
- **Always keep your private key secure and never commit it to version control**
- Consider using environment variable management tools for production deployments

### Deploy to Orbit Chains

Before deploying, you would have to ensure that your `deployStylusContract` function on your `deploy.ts` function has the `isOrbit` value set to `true` (example provided in `deploy.ts`).

Your contract must have an `initialize()` function as the replacement for the constructor, since not all orbit chains support the constructor feature. Please leave it blank if you don't have any constructor.

> Make sure you handle initialization properly in your contract, meaning it should only be called once and functions should not run if contract is not initialized.

## Verify your contract (Highly Experimental)

<details>

#### Prerequisites

Your contract must meet Arbiscan's verification requirements:

- No external libraries
- No constructor arguments
- No custom optimization settings
- No specific compiler version requirements

Check full documentation for more [details](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/verifying-contracts-arbiscan#step-4-set-evm-version)

### Stylus Local Verification (Under Development)

Make sure your contract does not include constructor or constructor does not contain any args

```rs
[#constructor]
pub fn constructor(&mut self)
```

The scaffold includes built-in local verification to ensure your Stylus contract deployments are reproducible. To enable verification during deployment, set `verify: true` in your deployment script:

```ts
await deployStylusContract({
  contract: "your-contract",
  verify: true,
  ...deployOptions,
});
```

This runs `cargo stylus verify` locally after deployment, which:

- Verifies that the deployed bytecode matches your source code
- Ensures reproducibility across different environments
- Validates the deployment transaction

**Note:** This feature is still under development and may not work as expected. Check full documentation for more [details](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/verifying-contracts)

### Arbiscan Verification

For public verification on Arbiscan, follow these steps:

#### Steps

1. **Create a dedicated repository** containing only your contract source code
2. **Navigate to Arbiscan**:
   - Go to [Arbiscan Verify Contract](https://arbiscan.io/verifyContract)
   - Enter your deployed contract address
3. **Follow the verification process**:
   - Select "Solidity (Standard-Json-Input)" as the compiler type
   - Enter your contract source code (github link)
   - Provide any constructor arguments if applicable
   - Submit for verification

Check official document for detail instructions: <https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/verifying-contracts-arbiscan>

> **Note**: Arbiscan verification for Stylus contracts is still evolving. If you encounter issues, consider using the local verification method or check Arbiscan's latest documentation for Stylus-specific instructions.

**Tip**: If you still want to initialize your contract, then add your own `initialize()` function and initialize it yourself
Sample :

```
pub fn initialize(&mut self, initial_number: U256) {
   if !self.is_initialized.get() {
      self.number.set(initial_number);
      self.is_initialized.set(true);
   } else {
      panic!("Counter already initialized");
   }
}
```

Then use `cast --rpc-url <your-rpc-url> --private-key <your-private-key> [deployed-contract-address] "initialize(uint256)" <initial_number>`
Or check [`deploy_contract.ts` lines 95-118](packages/stylus/scripts/deploy_contract.ts#L95-L118) and add it to your `deploy.ts` script.

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### 1. `stylus` Not Recognized

If you encounter an error stating that `stylus` is not recognized as an external or internal command, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libssl-dev
```

After that, check if `stylus` is installed by running:

```bash
cargo stylus --version
```

If the version is displayed, `stylus` has been successfully installed and the path is correctly set.

#### 2. ABI Not Generated

If you face issues with the ABI not being generated, you can try one of the following solutions:

- **Restart Docker Node**: Pause and restart the Docker node and the local setup of the project. You can do this by deleting all ongoing running containers and then restarting the local terminal using:

  ```bash
  yarn run dev
  ```

- **Modify the Script**: In the `run-dev-node.sh` script, replace the line:

  ```bash
  cargo stylus export-abi
  ```

  with:

  ```bash
  cargo run --manifest-path=Cargo.toml --features export-abi
  ```

- **Access Denied Issue**: If you encounter an access denied permission error during ABI generation, run the following command and then execute the script again:

  ```bash
  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER target
  ```

#### 3. üö® Fixing Line Endings and Running Shell Scripts in WSL

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This guide provides step-by-step instructions to resolve the Command not found error caused by CRLF line endings in shell scripts when running in a WSL environment.

Shell scripts created in Windows often have `CRLF` line endings, which cause issues in Unix-like environments such as WSL. To fix this:

**Using `dos2unix`:**

1. Install `dos2unix` (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install dos2unix
   ```

2. Convert the script's line endings:

   ```bash
   dos2unix run-dev-node.sh
   ```

3. Make the Script Executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run-dev-node.sh
   ```

4. Run the Script in WSL:

   ```bash
   bash run-dev-node.sh
   ```
